# PetSureWebApp
html form of technical exam

This project consist of two solutions 
  1. web-api
  2. web forms
  
The web-api has a local sql server database (.mdf) that has a petstable. This are the list of pets that will be shown on the dropdown
control in the web forms. I use annotation routing since im used to this kind of web api routing mechanism.

The web forms is just typical html 5 page yet responsive , i had use bootstrap to make it responsive. Also functional perfect due
to jquery.

I had separated the two projects on different solutions so that i can visualize better if the web-forms are working remotely to the 
web api.

First i assume file upload will be posted directly to the database but upon reading i decided to just make it save on the local directory 
under "upload" folder.
