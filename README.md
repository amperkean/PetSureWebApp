This project consist of two solutions 
1.web-api
2.web forms
The web-api has a local sql server database (.mdf) that has a petstable. This are the list of pets that will be shown on
the dropdown control in the web forms.

I use annotation routing since im used to this kind of web api routing mechanism.

The web forms is just typical html 5 page yet responsive , i had use bootstrap to make it responsive.
Also functional perfect due to jquery.
I had separated the two projects on different solutions so that i can visualize better if the web-forms are working remotely 
to the web api.
First i assume file upload will be posted directly to the database but upon reading i decided to just make it
save on the local directory under "upload" folder.
